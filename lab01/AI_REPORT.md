# AI Assistance Report

## Basic Information
- **Student:** Nuray Koshan
- **Lab:** 01 - React Fundamentals


## Part 1: How I Used AI

### Questions I Asked ChatGPT/DeepSeek:

1. **Conceptual questions:**
   - "Can you explain the difference between imperative and declarative programming in simple terms?"
   - "What does 'React is just the view layer' actually mean?"
   - "How does Virtual DOM make React faster than direct DOM manipulation?"

2. **Clarification questions:**
   - "What exactly should be in the comparison report for Lab 1.1?"
   - "How many words are required for each written assignment?"
   - "What's the difference between Task 3 in Lab 1.1 and Lab 1.2?"

3. **Technical questions:**
   - "What's the correct syntax for conditional className in React?"
   - "How do I properly structure a React project with Vite?"
   - "What are conventional commits and how do I write them?"

### How I Used the Answers:
- I listened to explanations but wrote my own understanding
- I asked for examples but then created my own implementations
- I used AI to clarify requirements but followed them myself

## Part 2: What I Did Myself

### Code Development:
- Typed every line of code manually in VS Code
- Created all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files myself
- Designed the UI/UX and color schemes independently
- Debugged errors by reading console messages and React warnings

### File Organization:
- Created the folder structure (task1/, task2/, etc.)
- Set up React projects using npm commands
- Organized components and styles logically

### Learning Process:
- Read the textbook chapters as required
- Experimented with different approaches
- Tested each implementation thoroughly
- Made mistakes and learned from them

## Part 3: What I Did NOT Do

### Strictly Avoided:
- Did NOT use GitHub Copilot or any code completion AI
- Did NOT copy-paste any code from AI responses
- Did NOT ask AI to write code for me
- Did NOT use AI to generate entire files

### Ethical Boundaries:
- All code logic is my own understanding
- All implementations are my own work
- All design decisions are my own
- All problem-solving was done by me

## Part 4: What I Learned

### Technical Skills:
- How to set up React projects with Vite
- The practical difference between jQuery and React
- How to use useState hook for state management
- Proper React component structure

### Conceptual Understanding:
- Imperative vs declarative programming paradigms
- React's Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm
- Component-based architecture benefits
- State-driven UI development

## Part 5: Time Investment

### Active Development Time:
- Reading assignment and textbook: 45 minutes
- jQuery implementation: 50 minutes
- React highlight implementation: 65 minutes
- React counter implementation: 40 minutes
- Writing reports and documentation: 55 minutes
- Testing and debugging: 35 minutes
- **Total:** Approximately 4.5 hours

### Learning Value:
This lab was valuable because I:
1. Experienced both old and new approaches to web development
2. Understood why React's declarative model is powerful
3. Gained practical experience with React hooks
4. Learned to structure projects properly

## Part 6: Verification

I confirm that:
- All submitted work is my own
- AI was used only for clarification and learning
- No academic dishonesty occurred
- I understand all concepts in the submitted work
