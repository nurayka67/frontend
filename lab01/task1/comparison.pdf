Lab 1.1 - Comparison Report
Student: Nuray Koshan

For this lab, I implemented the same highlight toggle feature twice: 
once with jQuery (imperative) and once with React (declarative).

In the jQuery version, I wrote step-by-step instructions:
1. I selected the button using $('#toggleBtn')
2. I attached a click handler with .click()
3. Inside the handler, I found the paragraph with $('#text')
4. I toggled the class with .toggleClass('highlight')
5. I manually updated the button text based on the state

This felt like giving detailed directions to the browser for every action.

In the React version, I took a different approach:
1. I created state with: const [isHighlighted, setIsHighlighted] = useState(false)
2. I described how the UI should look: className={isHighlighted ? 'highlight' : ''}
3. I set up an onClick handler that only updates the state
4. React automatically handled all DOM updates

The key difference is control vs declaration. With jQuery, I controlled 
every DOM operation. With React, I declared the desired outcome, and 
React figured out how to make it happen.

As mentioned in Chapter 1 "Declarative UI structures", React lets us 
describe what the UI should look like rather than how to change it. 
The section "Data changes over time" explains how React updates the 
UI when data (state) changes.

Why is React's approach better for scaling? 
- With complex UIs, manually tracking DOM changes becomes error-prone
- React's component model makes code more organized and reusable  
- The Virtual DOM optimizes updates, so performance remains good
- State management is centralized and predictable

For this simple toggle, both approaches work. But for larger 
applications with many interactive elements, React's declarative 
model would be much easier to maintain and extend.
