Lab 1.2 - View Layer Explanation
Student: Nuray Koshan

The Counter app demonstrates React's role as the "view layer" in 
web development. As explained in Chapter 1 "React is just the view 
layer", React focuses exclusively on transforming data into UI, 
leaving other concerns like routing or data fetching to other 
libraries.

In my Counter component:
1. I used useState(0) to create count state
2. The UI displays the current count value: {count}
3. Buttons have onClick handlers that update the state
4. When state changes, React automatically re-renders the component

This data flow is central to React: 
State (data) → Component (view) → UI (output)

When I click the "Increment" button:
1. The onClick handler calls setCount(count + 1)
2. React updates the count state
3. React re-renders the Counter component with the new state
4. The displayed number updates from, say, 0 to 1

The magic happens behind the scenes with React's Virtual DOM, 
mentioned in Chapter 1 "Performance matters". Instead of directly 
manipulating the real DOM (which is slow), React:
1. Creates a lightweight JavaScript representation (Virtual DOM)
2. Compares it with the previous version (diffing)
3. Calculates the minimal changes needed (patching)
4. Applies only those changes to the real DOM

For the Counter, this means only the number text updates when I 
click buttons - not the entire button or container. This makes 
React applications fast and efficient.

Setting up the project was straightforward using Vite, as suggested 
in "Setting up a new React project". The clear separation between 
data (state) and presentation (components) makes React code easier 
to understand and maintain than traditional jQuery code where 
logic and DOM manipulation are mixed together.
